Programming Assignment 3-1: Below, a class Account is defined, and the class Employee, as defined in the lecture, is shown and refactor the code. For more information see readme.

The Employee class discussed in the lecture is reproduced here. To create an instance of Account, you must pass in an Employee and a String name for an account type, and, optionally, the starting balance. If you do not specify a starting balance, then the default balance (which is defined by a constant, and initially set to the value 0.0) is used. The possible kinds of account type are indicated by three public constants â€“ CHECKING, SAVINGS, and RETIREMENT. These constants should always be used whenever an account type needs to be specified by name.
In this assignment, do the following:
1. Refactor the Account class so that the three account types CHECKING, SAVINGS, RETIREMENT, are the three instances of an enumerated type called AccountType; like Java classes, the enum should be placed in a separate file. After defining this enum and removing the account types from the Account class, make the necessary changes to
instance variables and the constructors of Account.
2. Add the following methods to the Account class:
//updates the balance field
public void makeDeposit(double val);
//updates the balance field and returns true, unless
//withdrawal amount is too large; in that case,
//it does not modify the balance field, and returns false
public boolean makeWithdrawal(double amount)
3. Add public accessor methods for the fields acctType and balance.
4. Correct the implementation of getHireDay() in Employee, as discussed in the lecture.
5. Create a class Main having a main method that does the following:
a. It creates a new Employee object employee (you can invent your own name, hireday, salary, etc., to be used in the constructor)
b. Then it creates a checking account, savings account and retirement account for employee, each with a starting balance of $300.
c. Then it prints to the console the account data for each of these accounts (making use of the toString() method that has been provided in Account)
